    "#### Problem 1: the \"lift-up\" solution\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Kierran presented us the Rayleigh criterion for *modal* instability and from that we can deduce that unstratified Couette flow $U(z)=\\Lambda z$ is modally stable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite that, we'll construct a solution to the linearized perturbation equations about the Couette flow that grows.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 1\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider **three dimensional** perturbations about $\\boldsymbol{u} = \\Lambda z\\,\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{x}} + \\boldsymbol{u}'(x, y, z, t)$. Write the linearized equations the these perturbations obey. (Don't forget incompressibility.)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 2\n",
    "\n",
    "Assume two-dimensional perturbations **but** not the ones we usually have been assuming... Consider that the perturbations depend on $y$ and $z$ but *not* on $x$. Then expand all perturbation fields as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\phi'(y, z, t) = \\widehat{\\phi}(y, t)\\,e^{\\mathrm{i} m z} .$$\n",
    "\n",
    "(We don't write the perturbations' time-dependance as $e^{\\sigma t}$ because we are not looking for modal instabilities. One need not bother with modal instabilities for this problem since Rayleigh's necessary criterion for instability is not satisfied.)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 3\n",
    "Use the incompressibility equation and show that you can express $v'$ and $w'$ in terms of a streamfunction $\\psi'(y, z, t)$. Thus our three-dimensional perturbation field is now described by two fields: $u'$ and $\\psi'$.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 4\n",
    "By manipulating the $v'$ and $w'$ equation deduce that one possible solution has both $v'$ and $w'$ not varying with time. (Form the equation for the $x$-component of the vorticity and show that a streamfunction $\\psi'(y,z)$ satisfies it.)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 5\n",
    "Finally, use the $u'$ equation to show that:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    " u'(y, z, t) & = u'_0 + w'_0\\,\\Lambda\\, t,\\\\\n",
    " \\upsilon'(y, z, t) &= \\upsilon'_0,\\\\\n",
    " w'(y, z, t) &= w'_0.\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\boldsymbol{u}'_0 = \\boldsymbol{u}'(y, z, t=0)$ is the initial (infinitesimal) flow perturbation.\n",
    "\n",
    "You have just discovered a flow field that *(i)* satifies the perturbation equations and *(ii)* grows linearly with time! Note that although it grows, it does not grows *exponentially* with time.\n",
    "\n",
    "This solution is often called the \"lift-up\" solution. Can you think why is called like that? Try to visualize what the perturbation field is doing to enable $u'$ to grow and you'll see why..."

    "Consider again the Couette flow basic state and the linearized equations that govern a perturbation flow about it. Now take two-dimensional perturbations as we used to take up to now:\n",

    "$$\\boldsymbol{u}(x, z, t) = \\big[\\Lambda z+ u'(x, z, t)\\big]\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{x}} + w'(x, z, t)\\,\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{z}}.$$ As usual, using the incompressibility we can express $u'$ and $w'$ through a streamfunction $\\psi'$.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 1\n",
    "\n",
    "Write down (or derive it from the $u'$ and $w'$ linearized  momentum equations) the equation satisfied by $\\psi'$. This is a simplified version Rayleigh's equation with $\\partial_z^2U(z)=0$. You should get:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$(\\partial_t + \\Lambda z\\partial_x)\\,\\zeta'=0, \\tag{1}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\zeta'$ is the vorticity $\\zeta'=(\\boldsymbol{\\nabla}\\times\\boldsymbol{u}')\\boldsymbol{\\cdot}\\widehat{\\mathbf{y}} = \\partial_z u'-\\partial_x w'= -\\nabla^2\\psi'$. Solving (1) implies finding either $\\zeta'$ or $\\psi'$, since the two are related. \n",

    "\n",
    "#### Step 3\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This solution is called the \"Kelvin-Orr shearing wave\". Plot contour plots of snapshots of $\\psi'$ (remember to take the real part) for various values of $t$. (Perhaps even better draw a movie.) Use any domain, e.g., $(x, z)\\in [-2\\pi, 2\\pi]\\times[-2\\pi, 2\\pi]$ and plot the solution  for various initial wavenumbers $k_0$, $m_0$ and values of $\\Lambda$.\n",
