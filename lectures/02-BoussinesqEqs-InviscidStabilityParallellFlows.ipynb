    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is our equation(s) of motion or our dynamical law. The state $\\phi$ includes all variables needed to describe the state of the system. For example, for a pendulum that evolves freely in three dimensions $\\phi$ includes the position and the velocity of its free end, that is $\\phi$ consists of just 6 numbers. For the motion of a string on a guitar $\\phi$ then includes the deviation of each point on the string from rest, as well as the velocity of each points. Thus $\\phi$ in this case consiste of two **fields** (otherwise functions) that denote the elevation and velocity of each point of the string.\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\mathcal{F}$ denotes the dynamical law that governs the evolution of the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\xi$ above denotes external forcing on the system (e.g., gravity forces or some external excitation)\n",

    "They are called equilibria or fixed points because if the system finds itself in one of these states then it will stay there for eternity.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Stability theory* is the study of how our system behaves if its state starts very close but not quite at one of these equilibrium states $\\phi^e$. In other words, what will happen if we start with $\\phi = \\phi^e + \\phi'$ with $|\\phi'|\\ll|\\phi^e|$?\n",
    "1. Will the small perturbation $\\phi'$ die out and the system end up to the equilibrium state after some time?\n",
    "2. Will the system go away from state $\\phi^e$ and evolve to something completely different?\n",
    "3. Will the system keep oscilating around the state $\\phi^e$ but never quite reach it?\n",
    "4. Will the system go away from state $\\phi^e$ and then after long time eventually return back and reach $\\phi^e$?\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of the scenaria above describe a diffent notion of stability.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We will begin the course by studying what we call **modal stability theory**. In this context, the fixed point is characterized **unstable** if there exist at least some subset of all available perturbations $\\phi'$ which will grow away from $\\phi^e$ **in an exponential rate**, i.e., $\\sim \\exp{\\left[ (\\textrm{some positive real number})\\times t\\right]}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Later on we will study the fascinating notion of transient growth and non-normality. This comes under the name **generalized stability theory** and it often describes a situation like the scenario 4. above. Perturbations can grow (but not at an exponential rate). However, they can ofter grow *a lot*! This situation usual in problems in fluid dynamics and the reason for that is that often the linear operators that govern the perturbation dynamics in fluids problems are *non-normal*. (More details on non-normality will come in a following lecture.)\n",
