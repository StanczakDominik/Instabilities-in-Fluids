    "This is our equation(s) of motion or our dynamical law. The state $\\phi$ includes all variables needed to describe the state of the system. For example, for a pendulum that evolves freely in three dimensions $\\phi$ includes the position and the velocity of its free end, that is $\\phi$ consists of just 6 numbers. For the motion of a string on a guitar $\\phi$ then includes the deviation of each point on the string from rest, as well as the velocity of each points. Thus $\\phi$ in this case consiste of two **fields** (otherwise functions) that denote the elevation and velocity of each point of the string.\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\mathcal{F}$ denotes the dynamical law that governs the evolution of the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\xi$ above denotes external forcing on the system (e.g., gravity forces or some external excitation)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Fixed points** or **equilibrium points** are special values of $\\phi=\\phi^e$ which satisfy:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathcal{F}(\\phi^e) + \\xi  = 0.  \\tag{2}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "They are called equilibria or fixed points because if the system finds itself in one of these states then it will stay there for eternity.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Stability theory* is the study of how our system behaves if its state starts very close but not quite at one of these equilibrium states $\\phi^e$. In other words, what will happen if we start with $\\phi = \\phi^e + \\phi'$ with $|\\phi'|\\ll|\\phi^e|$?\n",
    "1. Will the small perturbation $\\phi'$ die out and the system end up to the equilibrium state after some time?\n",
    "2. Will the system go away from state $\\phi^e$ and evolve to something completely different?\n",
    "3. Will the system keep oscilating around the state $\\phi^e$ but never quite reach it?\n",
    "4. Will the system go away from state $\\phi^e$ and then after long time eventually return back and reach $\\phi^e$?\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of the scenaria above describe a diffent notion of stability.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We will begin the course by studying what we call **modal stability theory**. In this context, the fixed point is characterized **unstable** if there exist at least some subset of all available perturbations $\\phi'$ which will grow away from $\\phi^e$ **in an exponential rate**, i.e., $\\sim \\exp{\\left[ (\\textrm{some positive real number})\\times t\\right]}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Later on we will study the fascinating notion of transient growth and non-normality. This comes under the name **generalized stability theory** and it often describes a situation like the scenario 4. above. Perturbations can grow (but not at an exponential rate). However, they can ofter grow *a lot*! This situation usual in problems in fluid dynamics and the reason for that is that often the linear operators that govern the perturbation dynamics in fluids problems are *non-normal*. (More details on non-normality will come in a following lecture.)"
